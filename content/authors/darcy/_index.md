I bridge social and physical sciences in high-impact research that results in policy change. My work supports the realization of resilient rural, underserved, and vulnerable communities, with a specific focus on ensuring all communities have sustained access to water, housing, and economic development. I have a B.S. and M.S. in Hydrologic Sciences from UC Davis where I studied everything water â€” from understanding sediment transport in rivers, to graphing social networks involved in sea level rise adaptation, to highlighting inequities in groundwater access and policy in California's Central Valley.
