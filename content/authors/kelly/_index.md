Kelly is a civil and environmental engineer currently working for Sherwood Design Engineers in Santa Cruz, California. She supports the design, documentation, and permitting of many types of projects including decentralized water and wastewater systems, trails design, creek restoration, stormwater management, and utility master planning. In addition to private consulting, Kelly has worked in the public sector and academia as an environmental engineer; these include supporting various research projects at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley and providing regulatory oversight for groundwater remediation projects at the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. Outside of engineering, Kelly has publications on the subjects of California groundwater law and efforts to end student hunger and homelessness at UC Berkeley.

Kelly is most interested in using her technical skills to serve those without access to basic resources or infrastructure.
