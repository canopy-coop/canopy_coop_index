## Getting started

<br>  

```
install.packages("phdcoop")

pip install phdcoop
```


Those don't actually work, but they do illustrate a key aspiration of phd.coop: _starting a consulting practice should be as easy as installing an R or Python package!_

<br>  

## Cooperative benefits

We're so excited that you're interested in joining! Our mission at phd.coop is to make it extremely easy for experts to start consulting. To us, that looks like going from zero to having a business in 3 days. That includes:

- 📝 __insurance__ : commercial, professional, and general liability  
- 🙋 __mentorship__ : help crafting SOWs and selling your work  
- 💵 __finances__ : bank account, invoicing templates, taxes  
- ✉️ __communication and data__ : email and drive storage  
- 🕸️ __network__: expert colleagues to collaborate with
- ⚖️ __legal__ : expert counsel and dialed legal forms       
- 🖥️ __branding__ : website and marketing
