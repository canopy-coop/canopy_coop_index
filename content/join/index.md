## Getting started

<br>  

```
install.packages("phdcoop")

pip install phdcoop
```


Those don't actually work, but they do illustrate a key aspiration of phd.coop: _starting a consulting practice should be as easy as installing an R or Python package!_

<br>  

## Cooperative benefits

We're so excited that you're interested in joining! Our mission at phd.coop is to make it extremely easy for experts to start consulting. To us, that looks like going from zero to having a business in 3 days. That includes:

- üìù __insurance__ : commercial, professional, and general liability  
- üôã __mentorship__ : help crafting SOWs and selling your work  
- üíµ __finances__ : bank account, invoicing templates, taxes  
- ‚úâÔ∏è __communication and data__ : email and drive storage  
- üï∏Ô∏è __network__: expert colleagues to collaborate with
- ‚öñÔ∏è __legal__ : expert counsel and dialed legal forms       
- üñ•Ô∏è __branding__ : website and marketing

## The cooperative model

## Our story

The founders of PhD Cooperative met during their doctoral studies and bonded over a desire for creative, meaningful, self-directed work outside of academia. They wanted to work on the kind of interesting, stimulating, issues typically found in academia, but outside of the trappings of the [crack]academic career path. This led one founder to the private sector, but the extremely large overhead and hierarchical corporate structures typical of most firms was discouraging, unsustainable, and didn't allow for creative control. In 2021, Water Data Lab (WaDL) was founded and quickly grew into a successful consulting business. In the process, we learned how to start and operate a consulting business the hard way. As we started to help other friends follow in our footsteps, we saw an opportunity to create a non-hierarchical, worker-owned consulting cooperative that enabled experts to rapidly launch their own consulting practice. _PhD Cooperative_ is the result of our learnings in the consulting space, it is a network of experts to collaborate with, it's a  a set of systems and procedures to streamline business operations, and it's a platform to empower experts to focus on getting work done while the cooperative administrates details.
